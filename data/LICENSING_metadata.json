JCAR–FCL 1.080 and JCAR –FCL 2.080 require holders of a flight crew\nlicence to record details  of all flights flown in a format acceptable to the\nCARC. This logbook enables pilot licence holders to record flying\nexperience in a manner which will facilitate this process while providing a\npermanent record of the licence holders flying. Pilots who fly  regularly\nAirplanes and helicopters or other aircraft types are recommended to\nmaintain separate logbooks for each type of flying.\n2.

The flight crew subsequently\nidentifies the error during a crosscheck prior to the Final Approach Fix\n(FAF). However, instead of using a basic mode (e.g. heading) or manually\nflying the desired track, both flight crew members become involved in\nattempting to r eprogram the correct approach prior to reaching the FAF.\nAs a result, the aircraft \"stitches\" through the localiser, descends late, and\ngoes into an unstable approach.

A Type Rating Trainin g Organisa tion (TRTO) is an organisa tion\nstaffed, equippe d and operated in a suitable environmen t offering type\nrating training , and/or MCC-training , and/or synthetic flight instruction\nand, if applicable , theoretical instruction for speci fic trainin g programmes .\n2. A TRTO wishin g to offer approved trainin g to meet JCAR FCL2\nrequirements shall obtain the approval of CARC. No such approval will be\ngranted by CARC unless :\n(a) CARC can enforce the JCAR FCL2 requirements; and\n(b) the TRTO meets all requirements of JCAR FCL2.\nThis Appendi x gives the requirements for the issue , revalida tion and\nvariation of the approval of a TRTO.\nOBTAINING APPROVAL\n3.
